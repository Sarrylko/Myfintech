Always Create a new branch for your changes, and open a pull request to merge your changes into the main branch. This allows for code review and discussion before the changes are merged.
When creating a pull request, provide a clear and descriptive title, and include a detailed description of the changes you have made. This helps reviewers understand the purpose of the changes and the context in which they were made.
Make sure to follow the project's coding standards and guidelines when making changes. This includes adhering to the project's style guide, writing clean and maintainable code, and including appropriate tests for your changes.
Before opening a pull request, ensure that your changes are properly tested and do not introduce any new bugs or issues. Run the project's test suite and fix any failing tests before submitting your changes for review.
Be responsive to feedback from reviewers. If changes are requested, make the necessary updates to your code and update the pull request accordingly. Engage in constructive discussions with reviewers to clarify any questions or concerns they may have about your changes.
By following these guidelines, you can contribute to the project in a collaborative and efficient manner, ensuring that your changes are reviewed and integrated smoothly into the main branch.
